# Weather Quick Look

## Description

The Weather Quick Look app allows a user to search weather data by city by using the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api).  The user can see the current weather in the city searched for, as well as a 5-day forecast in a clean, simple layout.  The user's search history will appear on the left-hand side of the page.  When the user re-visits the page, the weather data for their last search will populate and their search history will be up to date, with the data being pulled from localStorage.  
  
Here's a quick look at what this app can do.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery v3.2.1
* GitHub
* [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## What I learned by creating this app

* Reinforced the use of APIs and localStorage.

* Continued to refine jQuery skills.

## Areas for improvement

* I would like to create a search history that only stores the user's most frequently searched-for cities.

* I would like to have the user's local weather populate on the screen when they visit for the first time.

## Installation

If you want to check out this app's features on your local machine, check out [Github's documentation on forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).  Also, you will need to get an API key from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api).  My API key is a free version so I only get so many API calls; thanks for helping keep my site live!
