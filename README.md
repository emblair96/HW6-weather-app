## Description of Work Completed

[The Weather Quick Look app](https://emblair96.github.io/HW6-weather-app/) allows a user to search weather data by city by using the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api).  The user can see the current weather in the city searched for, as well as a 5-day forecast in a clean, simple layout.  The user's search history will appear on the left-hand side of the page.  When the user re-visits the page, the weather data for their last search will populate and their search history will be up to date, with the data being pulled from localStorage. 

## What I learned by creating this app

* Reinforced the use of APIs and localStorage.

* Continued to refine jQuery skills.

## Areas for improvement

* I would like to create a search history that only stores the user's most frequently searched-for cities.  

## Installation

## Credits

I used the awesome Chrome browser extension [Screencastify](https://www.screencastify.com/) to record a quick demo of the app.  Also, [Open Weather Map's](https://openweathermap.org/api) great APIs allowed me to generate the weather data.
