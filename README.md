# weather-quick-look-app

## Description of Work Completed

The Weather Quick Look app allows a user to search weather data by city by using the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api).  The user can see the current weather in the city searched for, as well as a 5-day forecast in a clean, simple layout.  The user's search history will appear on the left-hand side of the page.  When the user re-visits the page, the weather data for their last search will populate and their search history will be up to date, with the data being pulled from localStorage.  
  
Here's a quick look at what this app can do.

### Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery v.3.2.1
* GitHub
* [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* [Screencastify](https://www.screencastify.com/) to record app demo gif

### What I learned by creating this app

* Reinforced the use of APIs and localStorage.

* Continued to refine jQuery skills.

### Areas for improvement

* I would like to create a search history that only stores the user's most frequently searched-for cities.

* I would like to have the user's local weather populate on the screen when they visit for the first time.
